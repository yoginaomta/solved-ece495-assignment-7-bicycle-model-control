<ul>

 <li>To understand the state and inputs of a kinematic bicycle model</li>

 <li>To know how to compute control inputs for a desired bicycle model trajectory</li>

</ul>

In this assignment, you are provided with a kinematic bicycle model describing the differential equations of motion for a given vehicle, as well as its control inputs. You will discretize these equations of motion, and use them to generate trajectories for the vehicle.

<h1>Resources and Instructions</h1>

There are 2 TODO sections to complete in the given Jupyter notebook:

<ol>

 <li>Implement the step() function for the bicycle model according to the given equations of motion.</li>

 <li>Compute the required control inputs that cause the bicycle model to follow a specified figure 8 trajectory.</li>

</ol>
